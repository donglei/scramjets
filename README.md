This is an unfinished project I started in 2012. It's a web framework for the D language, heavily 
inspired by Django with some ideas from Pylons, Wt and my own.

Currently it has:

- URL routing.
- A SCGI handler.
- Request/Response cycle and objects.
- Cookie handler.
- Middleware support (similar to Django's).
- Multipart message parser.
- A very basic templating system.

Maybe some day I'll retake development but currently Vibe.d covers at my web-framework-in-D needs so 
I don't feel the need to scratch any itch anymore.
